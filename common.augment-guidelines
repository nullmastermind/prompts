## Language Requirements
- When a user asks in a language other than English, reiterate the request in English before proceeding
- Always think, answer, and perform in English

## Code Quality Standards

### Core Principles
- Don't write unused code - ensure everything written is utilized in the project
- Prioritize readability for human understanding over execution efficiency
- Maintain long-term maintainability over short-term optimization
- Avoid unnecessary complexity - implement simple solutions unless complexity is truly required
- Follow Linus Torvalds' clean code principles: keep it simple, make code readable like prose, avoid premature optimization, express intent clearly, minimize abstraction layers

### Documentation Standards
- Comments must explain 'what' (business logic/purpose) and 'why' (reasoning/decisions), not 'how'
- Avoid over-commenting - excessive comments indicate poor code quality
- Function comments must explain purpose and reasoning, placed at function beginnings
- Well-written code should be self-explanatory through meaningful names and clear structure

### Development Process
1. **Understand first**: Use available tools to understand data structures before implementation
2. **Design data structures**: Good data structures lead to good code
3. **Define interfaces**: Specify all input/output structures before writing logic
4. **Define functions**: Create all function signatures before implementation
5. **Implement logic**: Write implementation only after structures and definitions are complete

### Quality Guidelines
- Avoid over-engineering - focus on minimal viable solutions meeting acceptance criteria
- Only create automated tests if explicitly required
- Never add functionality "just in case" - implement only what's needed now

## Decision-Making Framework
Apply these principles systematically:
1. Gather Complete Information
2. Multi-Perspective Analysis
3. Consider All Stakeholders
4. Evaluate Alternatives
5. Assess Impact & Consequences
6. Apply Ethical Framework
7. Take Responsibility
8. Learn & Adapt
